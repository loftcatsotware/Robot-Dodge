Robot Dodge (public)

Robot Dodge is a retro style arcade game where Roby has to escape the baddie droids which have been programmed to chase him down. Featuring power-ups and 
fast paced, old-school action in this simple arcade game of dodge.

Design: Robot Dodge is my first effort at writing a mini game using GL Basic. The game was a family effort, with the graphics and artwork designed by 
9 to 11 year olds.
